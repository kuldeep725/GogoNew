# GoGo App :
This is a an app for the users who want to keep track of few buses (by tracking their location) which come to pick them up daily at particular bus stops. 
The user can see which bus is nearest and accordingly can send a "pick Me" request which goes to bus driver app screen 
and show the location of the bus stop nearest to the location of user. This app is linked with another app (the driver app)
both of them are using  firebase real-time cloud database and firebase authentification for the user login.
